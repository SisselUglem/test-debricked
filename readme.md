# Debricked Web Test

## Getting started
`cd` to project root, the run:
`yarn install` or `npm install`
`yarn watch` or `npm run watch`

Any assets you want to use should be put in the `src` folder, these are then compiled to the `public` folder. If you add things directly to the public folder they will likely get overwritten. Fonts and images may require you to rerun the watch command.
